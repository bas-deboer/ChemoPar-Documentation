Structures
==========

The 'structure' page at https://chemopar-db.net/structure/ provides detailed structural information on all chemokine structures stored in the database. Entries can be browsed and filter based on multiple annotations (PDB ID, Protein, Class, Organism, UniProt accession, Experimental Method, Resolution, Oligomeric state, Date, and Reference)

Structure info page
-------------------

The structure info page offers details about the chemokine structure and is divided into several key sections:

1. **Structure details**:
    - Displays fundamental structural information, including the resolution, oligomeric state, and details of the experimental method.
    - Provides direct links to the UniProt entry for the chemokine, the associated PDB page, and the DOI for the related research publication.

2. **3D view**:
    - Provides an interactive 3D molecular viewer using the NGL visualization tool.

3. **Interactions**:
    - For each chemokine chain in the structure, a link to the interaction page is provided to browse interaction details.

4. **Sequence alignment**:
    - For each chemokine chain, the aligned sequence in the structure to the canonical sequence listed in UniProt is presented, highlighting any mutations or differences and generic numbers from ChemoPar-db.

5. **Structure Entities**:
    - All entities in the structure are annotated and basic details are provided.
