Proteins
========

The 'protein' page at https://chemopar-db.net/protein/ provides an overview of all protein entries stored in the database 
and allows users to filter based on annotations (Chemokine type, Subfamily, Species and UniProt accession). Clicking on an entry
directs the users to that specific protein info page.

Protein info page
-----------------

The protein info page displays basic information about the selected protein and is divided into several key sections:

1. **Canonical Sequence and Structural Segmentation**:
    - Displays the full canonical sequence of the chemokine, segmented into structural motifs such as the N-terminal region, CX motif, N-loop, B-sheets, Î±-helix, and C-terminal segment.
    - Residues are mapped according to ChemoPar-db's residue numbering system.

2. **Interactive Chemokine Diagram**:
    - Provides a customizable 2D graphical representation of the chemokine sequence.
    - Users can download the diagram in multiple formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF, SVG) for use in publications and presentations.

3. **Related Structures**:
    - Lists all available structural entries of the chemokine in ChemoPar-db, including links to each structure's detailed page.
    - Each entry in the list includes details on the experimental method, resolution, oligomeric state, and PDB ID for quick reference.
