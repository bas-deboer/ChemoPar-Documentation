Protein Page
============

The `/protein/` page in ChemoPar-db provides detailed information for individual chemokine proteins, 
allowing users to explore structural, functional, and sequence-related aspects of each entry.

Overview
--------

Each protein entry offers an overview of essential details, including:

- **Protein Name and Alternate Names**: Common names, aliases, and standardized names as listed in UniProt.
- **Organism**: The species from which the protein originates, with a focus on human proteins and other model organisms.
- **UniProt Entry Link**: Direct access to the protein's UniProt page for comprehensive sequence and functional annotation.

Features
--------

The `/protein/` page is divided into several key sections, as described below:

1. **Canonical Sequence and Structural Segmentation**:
    - Displays the full canonical sequence of the chemokine, segmented into structural motifs such as the N-terminal region, 
    CX motif, N-loop, B-sheets, Î±-helix, and C-terminal segment.
    - Residues are mapped according to ChemoPar-db's residue numbering system, facilitating comparisons across chemokines 
    with consistent numbering.

2. **Interactive Chemokine Diagram**:
    - Provides a customizable 2D graphical representation of the chemokine sequence.
    - Users can download the diagram in multiple formats (PNG, JPG, TIFF, SVG) for use in publications and presentations.

3. **Related Structures**:
    - Lists all available structural entries of the chemokine in ChemoPar-db, including links to each structure's detailed page.
    - Each entry in the list includes details on the experimental method, resolution, oligomeric state, and PDB ID for 
    quick reference.


Navigation
----------

Users can navigate between different proteins using the "Browse" option, or search for specific proteins by name, 
UniProt ID, or related keywords. Links to structural entries and partner interactions are also available, providing 
a seamless experience for researchers to delve deeper into chemokine structure-function relationships.
